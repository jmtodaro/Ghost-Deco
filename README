Installation
------------
Move this folder into:
~/.kde/share/apps/aurorae/themes/

For example:
~/.kde/share/apps/aurorae/themes/Ghost-Deco/

IMPORTANT: This folder MUST be named "Ghost-Deco" or the theme WILL NOT WORK properly!

If you have downloaded the archive via github, you'll need to rename this folder from "Ghost-Deco-master" to "Ghost-Deco"
